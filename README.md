This is my personal zmk firmware for the scylla that I built with nice:nano v2s. It has support for a dongle and zmk studio which you can easily toggle by commenting/uncommenting in build.yaml (I haven't tested bluetooth and zmk studio but it probably works).
If you want to use this for yourself just fork it and change they keymap for your needs and it should probably work.
